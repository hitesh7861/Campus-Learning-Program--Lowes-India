To start the project just open your command line.

Navigate to the folder where you just saved the project folder and install the necessary package according to the json created using **npm install** so as to include the necessary **node modules**.

After that activate your MongoDB server and after that create the database of your own using MongoDB like we created the user 'hitesh' for the database admin using db.createUser({user:'hitesh',pwd:'1234',roles:['readWrite','dbAdmin']}) and connect that by mongoose.connect in app.js file.

And finally run the app by navigating to the folder and using the command **node app** on your terminal.
